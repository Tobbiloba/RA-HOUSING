Order for admin
    admin should be able to accept or decline order if they are the owner 
        Parameters:
            user_id
            property_id

How it should work:
    after fetching the orders for their properties
    then once they accept it the order should be updated to accepted and in the property detail the status should be also be updated 



add a function that when the admin adds a new property it then also save the property id in the user info

and how can i do it that i will be able to list all the order under all the properties owned by 1 person that is all orders under the person property should be listed
